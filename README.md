Repository contains exercises from two courses that were taught together.  
 - Development of distributed systems on server side  
 - Mobile Application Development  
both taught by Benny Bernfeld in Ruppin Academic Center.  

All Database related exercises will not work. because there are no passwords and usernames in the Web.config file for obvious reasons.  

This repo is about being proud in poor code that was good enough to a specific task and nothing else.  
The code in these exercises **IS NOT** an example of anything except syntax and basic ideas.
